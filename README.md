# Lunic Philosophy
Lunic Philosophy is my own philosophy and thoughts. It comes from its original name "Lunic Oculo" meaning "Moon's Eye" in English and "Lunic Oculism" which is when the theories and methods of this philosophy is **applied** to life.

I decided, why not make a website with all of my thoughts? I have quite a few by now and I'm currently writing a whole book about it.

Here are some photo's from my notes about Lunic Philosophy:
